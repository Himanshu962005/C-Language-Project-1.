# C-Language-Project-1.
This project is a simple game developed in the C programming language. It is designed to demonstrate the use of basic C concepts such as loops, conditional statements, functions, arrays, and user input/output handling. The game runs in the command-line interface (CLI), making it lightweight and easy to execute on any system with a C compiler.
